# Algorithms-And-Complexity-Practices
These are my solutions to the practices of Algorithms and complexity subject written in Java.

## Index
- **P0 Sorting Algorithms:** Sorting algorithms and their complexity, comparison in execution time.
- **P1 Divide and Conquer:** Divide and conquer based problem solution.

    The goal of this practice is to perform the sum of all of the positive elements of a circularly sorted vector. For the first part it has to be developed with a worst case algorithmic complexity of O(N), and for the second part, it has to be developed with a worst case complexity of O(LogN).

- **P2 Backtracking:** Backtracking and Branch and Bound for problem optimization.

    In order to succesfully solve this problem, it has to be applied bounding in order to discard candidates and optimize the search. The goal is to find the minimum number of mutations that the string1 requires to transform into string2. The available operations are maintaining, changing, removing or inserting characters ('A', 'G', 'C', 'T').

- **P3 Greedy:** Greedy algorithm for candidate selection and feasible solutions.

    Implement a greedy algorithm that maximizes the filling of an inventory with a set of objects of different sizes (width x height) and different values. It is not needed the optimal solution but an approximation.

- **P4 Dynamic Programming:** Dynamic programming problem, text processor.
